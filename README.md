## Hi, I'm Sina 👋

I build practical AI stuff with Python — mostly NLP and RAG chatbots — and I like projects that feel “real”, not just demos.

### What I mostly work on
- AI applications with a focus on **NLP and RAG-based systems**
- Backend development using **Python** (Flask / FastAPI)
- Designing end-to-end pipelines (data → model → API → UI)
- Hands-on projects that mix software with real systems (IoT, automation)

### Selected projects
- **RAG-based AI Chatbot**  
  A document-grounded chatbot built with retrieval + generation, focused on clean chunking, vector search, and reliable answers.

- **Smart Attendance Management System**  
  An IoT-based system using RFID and microcontrollers, connected to a web dashboard with real-time data synchronization.

### Technical background
- **Languages:** Python, C++, SQL  
- **AI / ML:** NLP, RAG pipelines, embeddings, vector databases  
- **Backend:** Flask, FastAPI, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** SQL-based systems  
- **Other:** Git, basic DevOps concepts, system-level thinking

### Outside of coding
When I’m not behind a screen, I enjoy long-distance cycling (nearly 9 years of experience), hiking, and exploring blockchain ecosystems — working with different networks, wallets, and crypto-based applications.
